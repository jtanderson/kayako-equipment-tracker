Kayako Equipment Tracking System
================================

This system is a standalone web-application with the goal
of aiding users of the Kayako Fusion service software to better regulate the influx of end-user equipment.
The software is not a replacement for any part of the Kayako Fusion system - it's most standard use case is
this:  A user arrives at the Service Desk, Help Desk, etc. with her laptop, charger, and a peripheral such
as an external hard driver.  All this equipment is now the responsibility of the technicians assisting this
troubled person.  Unfortunately, if this is a frequent occurrence, it would be shocking if somethings of
hers was *not* mixed up with somebody else equipment, lost, or otherwise.  Using our Kayako Equipment
Tracking System, the diligent service technician pulls up the application, enters the user's information and
logs each separate piece of equipment she brought.  The system then creates a ticket on the Kayako Fusion
server to reflect the main issue of the hardware and item each piece of equipment related to that issue.
The system then creates a barcode with the Kayako Fusion Display ID (e.g. KF-2213-J) and generates a barcode
which the technician can then print out and affix to the user's equipment.  It can then be scanned directly
into the Kayako Fusion Software's search function to determine its exact purpose and owner.

One can visit the project page on the [Kayako Forge](http://forge.kayako.com/projects/client-equipment-management) for
a more complete wiki, calendar, forum, issue tracking, and roadmap.

Note that support *is not* planned in the far future, as hopefully this (or just the concept) can be ported 
directly to a Kayako Fusion module and dropped into an existing server.
