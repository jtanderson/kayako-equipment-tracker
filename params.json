{"name":"Kayako Equipment Tracker","body":"Kayako Equipment Tracking System\r\n================================\r\n\r\nThis project is written by [Joseph Anderson](http://www.ratiocaeli.com).  This system is a standalone web-application with the goal of aiding users of the Kayako Fusion service \r\nsoftware to better regulate the influx of end-user equipment. The software is not a replacement for any \r\npart of the Kayako Fusion system - it's most standard use case is this:  A user arrives at the Service \r\nDesk, Help Desk, etc. with her laptop, charger, and a peripheral such as an external hard driver.  All \r\nthis equipment is now the responsibility of the technicians assisting this troubled person.  Unfortunately, \r\nif this is a frequent occurrence, it would be shocking if somethings of hers was *not* mixed up with \r\nsomebody else equipment, lost, or otherwise.  Using our Kayako Equipment Tracking System, the diligent \r\nservice technician pulls up the application, enters the user's information and logs each separate piece \r\nof equipment she brought.  The system then creates a ticket on the Kayako Fusion server to reflect the \r\nmain issue of the hardware and item each piece of equipment related to that issue. The system then creates \r\na barcode with the Kayako Fusion Display ID (e.g. KF-2213-J) and generates a barcode which the technician \r\ncan then print out and affix to the user's equipment.  It can then be scanned directly into the Kayako \r\nFusion Software's search function to determine its exact purpose and owner.\r\n\r\nIt is written using the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) PHP framework.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is still in an \"Alpha\" state, as all planned features have not been implemented.  However, installation should\r\nbe possible. Later, a more streamlined and portable installation script is planned.\r\n\r\nThe recommended hosting setup is an Apache server. The following modules are used in my current setup:\r\n\r\n* mod_ssl - the site is built to take advantage of cross-site encryption with SSL, recommended but not necessary\r\n* mod_rewrite - see this [Codeigniter Wiki entry](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/mod_rewrite)\r\n* mod_cache - to serve resources faster and more efficiently\r\n\r\nYou will also need PHP 5 with cURL, MySQL, and MySQLi.\r\n\r\nOne can find my vhost configuration files under the /etc folder to use as a guide. You should delete these \r\nfrom your production environment along with the /installation folder after you get the site set up.\r\n\r\nOnce you get the files, browse to http://yourservername.com/install and enter the items to set up the MySQL database.\r\n\r\nThe installation script adds an offline user with username and password \"OfflineAdmin\" - of course the password should be\r\nchanged after installation. This will hopefully be done by the install script in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, the system should be at the root of its respective virtual host.  Other configuration is theoretically\r\npossible but has not been tested.\r\n\r\nOnce you have finished the installation and verified that it is working, you should delete the /install directory \r\nand all of its contents.\r\n\r\n### Kayako Fusion Settings\r\n\r\nNote that there is an offline user included in the installation (Username: OfflineAdmin / Password: OfflineAdmin - for now) so \r\nthat if something goes wrong and the system cannot authenticate against the Kayako Fusion server, one can log in to change \r\nthe API settings.  The API settings are found under the \"System\" tab of the settings page.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne can visit the project page on the [Kayako Forge](http://forge.kayako.com/projects/client-equipment-management) for\r\na more complete wiki, calendar, forum, issue tracking, and roadmap.\r\n\r\nNote that support *is not* planned in the far future, as hopefully this (or just the concept) can be ported \r\ndirectly to a Kayako Fusion module and dropped into an existing server.\r\n\r\nOf course one may feel free to clone and change the software - it is licensed under the Open Software License (\"OSL\") v 3.0.\r\n\r\n[Developer Site](http://www.ratiocaeli.com)","tagline":"Kayako Extension to Track End-User Equipment","google":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">    var _gaq = _gaq || [];   _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-30544183-1']);   _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);    (function() {     var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;     ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
